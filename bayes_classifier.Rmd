This note book goes over a basic implementation of a Bayesian classifier, which I use to identify spam e-mails and toxic message board comments.  Much of the methodology is taken from 


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
